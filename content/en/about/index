About Student Robotics
======================

What is Student Robotics?
-------------------------

Student Robotics run an annual robotics [competition](/schools/game) for sixth-form schools and colleges.  All of the [kit](/schools/kit) the schools &amp; colleges use is designed, built, tested and distributed by us.

One of the main aims for us is to allow schools &amp; colleges to participate for very little or no cost: each team is given the electronics kit &mdash; for free &mdash; and a budget to help towards other parts (materials for the robot and motors, for example). To read more about what we aim to do, you might like to take a look at our [mission statement](/about/mission).
