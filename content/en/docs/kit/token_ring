The Token Ring
==============

The boards in the Student Robotics kit are connected together using a [ring topology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network).
This means that all in/out connectors on the boards need to be connected for the _token_ to passed around.
This _token_ is held by the board that is currently allowed to talk through the power board to the BeagleBoard.
If the loop is not complete, the token will not successfully circulate and the robot will not work.
Here's an example layout:

In this example, the token will be passed around clockwise, starting from the power board.
(It'll go from the power board, to the servo board, then back to the power board, then to the servo board, etc...)
The token is passed away from the power board's `OUT` socket, around the ring to its `IN` socket.

<div class="warning">Please Note: INs should only be connected to OUTs!</div>
