On-board Manual Controller
==========================

There will probably be times when you just want to do something simple with the robot without writing a program. For example, you might want to try out your new grabber by moving a servo or two, or find out what sort of values you can expect from a sensor. In these situations, the On-board Manual Controller might be useful. It allows you to do things like this using the buttons and knobs on the Power Board.

Currently, the controller program comes as a robot.zip. You can [download version 1.0 here](/resources/kit/sr-control/robot.zip). Put it on the robot in [the usual way](/docs/IDE/getting_code_on_the_robot), and then run it by pressing "Start".

Changing panels
---------------

![Change panels diagram](/images/content/kit/sr-control/changing-panels.png)

On the left of the control screen is a list of the boards you have connected, with one selected. To select another board, turn the left knob.

When you select a different board, the panel on the right of the screen will change to show that board's control panel. Each type of panel is described below.

Motor Board Panel
-----------------

This is the most simple panel. The dial shows the current speed of the motor. To change the speed, turn the right knob.

When one or more motors are running, the "Press to stop" button appears below the list of boards. While this button is visible, pressing the left knob will immediately stop all motors.

IO Board Panel
--------------------

The panel for the IO board has three rows of controls. The first shows the analogue value of each input pin, while the second shows the digital value. As these are input values, you can't change them through the controller.

The third row shows the state of the output pins, and allows you to change them. A pair of arrows appear next to one input; this is the currently selected one. You can turn it on or off by twisting the right knob. To select a different output, use the two buttons to the right of the screen.

Servo Board Panel
-----------------

The servo board has eight sliders, one for each output on the servo board. Each has a number, indicating the number of the corresponding output on the board. As on the Joint IO Panel, only one output is selected at once (indicated by the blue box), and the two buttons to the right of the screen select another output.

When you first power up the board, all the sliders will be orange. This means that the board hasn't positioned any servos yet, so their position is unknown. To position a servo, select it, turn the right knob until the slider shows the position you want, and press the right knob. The slider will turn blue to show that the position is now known. Turning the knob will now move the servo immediately.

<div class=warning>
Some servos have a smaller range of movement than others, and may be damaged if set to the extremes of the available range.  Please refer to the <a href="/docs/programming/sr/servos/#ServoAngle">servo board programming docs</a> for more information on this topic.
