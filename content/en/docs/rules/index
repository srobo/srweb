2015 Rules
==========

[<img class="left" src="/resources/2014/rulebook.jpg" />](/resources/2014/rulebook.pdf)
The rules, regulations and specifications for the SR 2015 competition will be
released at [Kickstart](/events/kickstart) 2015. Up until then, the competition game is a secret.

You can read last year's [rulebook](/resources/2014/rulebook.pdf) to get an idea
of the competition regulations. Some of these regulations may be changed for
the 2015 competition.
